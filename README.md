# Colorectal Cancer Prediction with MLflow+DagsHUB, Minikube Kubernetes & Kubeflow

A complete machine learning operations pipeline for predicting colorectal cancer using modern MLOps tools and practices. This project demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow deployment with MLflow experiment tracking, DagsHUB for data versioning, and Kubernetes orchestration using Minikube and Kubeflow.

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive MLOps pipeline that predicts colorectal cancer using patient data. The pipeline integrates MLflow for experiment tracking, DagsHUB for data and model versioning, and leverages Kubeflow Pipelines running on Minikube for local Kubernetes orchestration.

## Features

- **End-to-end ML Pipeline**: Complete workflow from data preprocessing to model deployment
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow integration for tracking experiments and model versions
- **Data Versioning**: DagsHUB for data and model version control
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubeflow Pipelines on Minikube for local Kubernetes development

## Dataset

The project uses colorectal cancer dataset from Kaggle, containing patient clinical features and histopathological data for cancer prediction.
